**Boku no Hero Academia**

*Description*: About my favorite series, it is called the Boku no Hero Academia Anime Series. It is an animated film by the Japanese where the Protagonist showcase his backstory on how he became the greatest Hero in the world. The series is more about the power of friendship, skills, teamwork and many more! Not only that, the series is filled with action packed scenes. There you would see how "Deku" the main character, developed his character, from a no one, to being the greatest hero of all time:astonished::astonished:. One thing I also liked about the series is the effects of the fight scenes. You can actually feel the fight:persevere::persevere:. As you can see below, the one with his powers looks so OP! :sob::sob::sob:
